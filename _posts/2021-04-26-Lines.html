<blockquote class="blockquote"> In Geometry, the notion of line or straight line was introduced by ancient mathematicians to represent straight objects (having no curve) with negligible width and depth. Lines are an idealization of such objects, which are often described in terms of two points or referred to using a single letter.</blockquote>

<h1 class="section-heading"> Vertical Lines </h1>

<p> The X-intercept of a graph is the point where the graph crosses the X-axis (Horizontal Axis). 
    A vertical line is a line, parallel to Y-axis and goes straight, up and down, in a coordinate plane. 
    The slope of a true vertical line is always equal to 1. Think of a vertical line as being a wall in a house,
    it seems strong, but you can still go through it. </p>

 <span class="caption text-muted"> Interactive Visual 1: As you move the slider, the vertical line always keeps a slope 
     of 1 and remains parallel to the Y-axis. Wherever it crosses the X-axis, is the X-intercept. </span>





<h1 class="section-heading"> Horizontal Lines </h1>

<p> The Y-intercept of a graph is the point where the graph crosses the Y-axis (Vertical Axis).
    Because functions must pass the Vertical Line Test, a function can have at most one Y-intercept.
    The Y-intercept is often referred to with just the Y-value of a graph. In the way of Graphic 1 below,
    the Y-intercept is equal to 2. Think of a horizontal line as being the ground you stand on,
    even though you can dig down and get much lower. </p>


<span class="caption text-muted"> Graphic 2: Here is an example of a Vertical Line! The Y-intercept is at 2! </span>

<h1 class="section-heading"> Slopes </h1>

<p> The slope of a line, or sometimes referred to as the gradient in mathematics, is a number that 
    measures the steepness and direction of a line, or a section of a line connecting two points.
     The slope is typically designated at the letter ‘M’. A line's steepness is measured by the 
     absolute value of its slope, M. </p>

<p> If a line increases in height from left to right, it has a positive slope. If a line decreased
     from left to right, it has a negative slope. </p>
