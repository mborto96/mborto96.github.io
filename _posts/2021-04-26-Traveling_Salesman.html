<h1 class="section-heading"> The Travelling Salesman Problem </h1>
<p> The travelling salesman problem asks the following question: "Given 
    a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what 
    is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once 
    and returns to the origin city?"  </p>



<blockquote class="blockquote"> Here are the distances between the four cities a salesman must
    go to during his trip. </blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote"> Here is an example of the Travelling Salesman Problem.
    If he started in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which would be the shortest route to hit 
    all cities and return to Pittsburgh? </blockquote>

<p> Due to how the cities are at the four regional corners of the United States, 
    the best path, starting from Pittsburgh, would be to go to Seattle or Miami First, then
    Los Angeles, and then afterwards, visit the city that has not been visited yet, and then
    finally, return to Pittsburgh. </p>
